  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: June 1, 2025</em></p>

  <p>At Netbook, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect (if any), how it is stored, and your rights as a user.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Netbook does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit your personal financial data to any servers. All data entered in the app is stored locally on your device and remains fully under your control.</p>

  <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
  <p>Netbook securely stores your financial entries, account information, and preferences on your device. No cloud storage or third-party syncing is used by default.</p>

  <h2>3. No Account Required</h2>
  <p>You do not need to create an account or provide any personal identifiers to use Netbook. Your experience is entirely anonymous.</p>

  <h2>4. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>Netbook does not use any analytics tools, tracking technologies, or advertising frameworks. We do not monitor your behavior or usage patterns.</p>

  <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>Purchases are handled through Apple’s App Store and comply with <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/">Apple’s Standard License Agreement</a>. We do not access or store your payment information.</p>

  <h2>6. Face ID and Security</h2>
  <p>If you enable Face ID or passcode locking, biometric data is handled securely by your device and is never accessible to us.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Backups</h2>
  <p>We recommend regularly backing up your device using iCloud or iTunes if you want to preserve your financial records. Netbook does not automatically back up or sync your data.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is nothing for us to modify, delete, or share. All data remains on your device unless you manually export it (e.g., CSV export).</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
